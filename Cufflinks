# Creating charts with KC housing data

pip install plotly
# Installing Plotly is a pre-req to installing Cufflinks
pip install cufflinks

# Importing required packages
import pandas as pd
import cufflinks as cf

df = pd.read_csv('C:/Users/youngc/Desktop/General Info/train.csv')

# Imports plotly and cufflinks in 'offline' mode, meaning results will display in a cell instead of a browser window
import plotly.offline
cf.go_offline()
cf.set_config_file(offline=False, world_readable=True)

# Defines the type of chart
df.iplot(kind='histogram')
